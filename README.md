## Installation

Clone this repository into the directory `~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/Message Styles/`

## Features

### Solarized

Solarized reduces brightness contrast but, unlike many low contrast colorschemes, retains contrasting hues (based on colorwheel relations) for syntax highlighting readability.

### Simple

This is a minimized theme that gets out of your way and makes message content central.

### Optimized for copy and paste

Copying and pasting from the message window will produce sane human readable output.
